3 | [2025-05-03 18:06:15] - Modular Architecture: The system is divided into multiple modules (User Interface, Orchestration Layer, Specialized Agents) with clear responsibilities.
4 | [2025-05-03 18:06:15] - Agent-Based Orchestration: Uses CrewAI to coordinate specialized agents for topic analysis, category breakdown, iterative refinement, and research integration.
5 | [2025-05-03 18:06:15] - Data Validation with Pydantic: Ensures schema integrity across all modules using Pydantic models.
6 | [2025-05-03 18:06:15] - Real-Time Processing with LMStudio: Utilizes a local LMStudio model running on 16GB VRAM for efficient NLP tasks.
7 | [2025-05-03 18:06:15] - Lightweight Web Framework (e.g., FastAPI/Flask): Used to build the user interface for prompt submission and result display.

### Modular Architecture
- Ensures clear separation of responsibilities among components.
- Enhances maintainability and scalability by allowing individual components to be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

### Agent-Based Orchestration
- Uses CrewAI to manage specialized agents effectively.
- Centralizes control and coordination, ensuring smooth interaction between different modules.

### Data Validation
- Implements Pydantic for robust data validation and schema enforcement.
- Ensures consistent data formats throughout the processing pipeline, reducing errors and improving reliability.

### Iterative Processing
- Processes prompts through multiple steps, leveraging external research inputs at each stage.
- Enables detailed refinement of input topics by breaking them into categories and producing comprehensive outputs.

### External Data Integration
- Integrates with web search tools, documentation browsers, and academic paper repositories to refine outputs iteratively.
- Enhances technical depth and accuracy of the final document by incorporating relevant external research data.
